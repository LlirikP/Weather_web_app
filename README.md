# Project 2: Weather Forecast Web Service for a Given Route

## Description

This project is a web service that uses the AccuWeather API to provide weather forecasts for a given route. The service allows users to obtain weather information for various points along the route, helping them better plan their trips.

## Project Goal

## Key Features

- Fetching weather data from the AccuWeather API.
- Assessing adverse weather conditions (such as rain, strong winds, temperature).
- Visualizing weather forecasts for different points along the route.
- Handling errors in data input and interaction with the API.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: for developing the web service.
- **Requests**: for interacting with the AccuWeather API.
- **Plotly** and **Dash**: for data visualization.
- **HTML** and **CSS**: for creating the web interface.
